# Additional singleton experiments

Here you'll find several versions of Theeuwes' (1992) additional singleton paradigm that I've recreated from scratch using Psychtoolbox. All of these were built using MATLAB R2017a and Psychtoolbox 3.0.14. 
At present there is no response logging nor data recording coded into the files. Those features will be included soon.

# uniAddSingleton100 (added October 5, 2017)
This is a unidimensional, fixed feature version of the additional singleton task with the distractor present on 100% of trials.

# multiAddSingleton100 (added October 6, 2017)
This is a multidimensional, fixed feature version of the additional singleton task with the distractor present on 100% of trials. 

# uniAddSingleton50 (added October 11, 2017)
This is a unidimensional, fixed feature version of the additional singleton task with the distractor present on 50% of trials.

# multiAddSingleton50 (added October 11, 2017)
This is a multidimensional, fixed feature version of the additional singleton task with the distractor present on 50% of trials.
