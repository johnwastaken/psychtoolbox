# Additional singleton experiments

Here you'll find several versions of Theeuwes' (1992) additional singleton paradigm that I've recreated from scratch using Psychtoolbox. All of these were built using MATLAB R2017a and Psychtoolbox 3.0.14. 
At present there is no response logging nor data recording coded into the files. Those features will be included soon.

# uniAddSingleton100 (added October 5, 2017)
This is a unidimensional, fixed feature version of the additional singleton task with the distractor present on 100% of trials.

# multiAddSingleton100 (added October 6, 2017)
This is a multidimensional, fixed feature version of the additional singleton task with the distractor present on 100% of trials. 

# uniAddSingleton50 (added October 11, 2017)
This is a unidimensional, fixed feature version of the additional singleton task with the distractor present on 50% of trials.

# multiAddSingleton50 (added October 11, 2017)
This is a multidimensional, fixed feature version of the additional singleton task with the distractor present on 50% of trials. 

# Change Localization experiment (added December 18, 2017)

In this task observers are shown a sample array containing six items in a circular array for a short period (e.g., 100 ms). After a brief delay (9000 ms), a test array appears and one of the items has changed color. Participants must then report at which location a color change occurred. Working memory capacity (k) can then be computed from task accuracy. This task is similar to what has been previously used by Gold et al., 2006 and Kyllingsbaek, & Bundesen, 2009, with one principle difference: the stimulus locations are fixed within a circular array, rather than varying in location from trial to trial.
