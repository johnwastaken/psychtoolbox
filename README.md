# psychtoolbox
Additional singleton experiments

Here you'll find some versions of Theeuwes' (1992) additional singleton paradigm that I've recreated from scratch using Psychtoolbox. All of these were built using MATLAB R2017a and Psychtoolbox 3.0.14. At present there is no response logging nor data recording coded into the files. If you wish to use the paradigm but are uncertain how to go about coding this in Psychtoolbox, send me a message and I'll include those features.

# uniAddSingleton100 (added October 5, 2017)
This is a unidimensional, fixed feature version of the additional singleton task with the distractor present on 100% of trials. This version is very similar to that used for Experiment 1 in Gaspar & McDonald (2014) with the exception that in that experiment, distractor probability was 50%.

# multiAddSingleton100 (added October 6, 2017)
Holy crap, drawing a diamond is Psychtoolbox is NOT intuitive. This is a multidimensional, fixed feature version of the additional singleton task with the distractor present on 100% of trials. This version is like the original Theeuwes (1992) additional singleton task and similar to that used for Experiment 2 in Gaspar & McDonald (2014) with the exception that in these experiments, distractor probability varied.
